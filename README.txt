                            ———— running the code ————


1. Implementation of code

On MacOS/Windows environment, enter the following:

For Windows, assume that your current working directory is C:\Users\Desktop>
(~\Desktop is where you put this script, or you can cd to where you put it.)

>python Apriori_fset.py 6 dataset_folder\ output_folder\

where “Apriori_fset.py” is the script name, 6 is the minSupport value you can specify, “dataset_folder\” is a directory name, which contains the dataset files, and “output_folder\” is a directory is the output location.
 

2. What the script does

It grabs all the dataset files in the dataset_folder and generates a new/uses an existing folder on your Desktop, named “output_folder”, which contains all the output files.


3. Dataset to use

Currently, you can test the code using the .txt dataset files attached.
Note: The first row in dataset would be skipped.
